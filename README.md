### ChaptTen.java includes the following methods from the corresponding chapters:

- 10.4  doubleList - takes an ArrayList of strings as
a parameter and replaces every string with two of that same string. For
example, "hello, world, again" would become "hello, hello, world, world, agian, again."

- 10.6  minToFront - takes an ArrayList of integers
as a parameter and moves the minimum value in the list to the front,
otherwise preserving the order of the elements. For example, "2, 3, 44, 1, 5" would become "1, 2, 3, 44, 5".

- 10.11 stutter - A method that accepts an ArrayList of strings and
an integer as it's parameter. The method replaces every string with copies
of that string in the same order. For example, a parameter of 3 of ArrayString, "hello, world, again" would become "hello, hello, hello, world, world, world, agian, agian, again."


- 10.15 filterRange - A method that accepts an ArrayList of
integers and two integer values (low and high) as parameters and
removes all elements whose values are in the range min through max
(inclusive). For example, a parameter containing the low and high of 3, 6 (respectively)
with an ArrayList containing "1, 2, 3, 44, 5, 6, 7" would become "1, 2, 44, 7".

Extra Credit: Project 10.2 - ProjectTenTwo.java - reads from a file and reverses the lines and the words. This program, only half way complete, only revereses the words... for now.
